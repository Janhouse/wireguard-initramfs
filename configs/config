# Wireguard initramfs configuration.
#
# NOTE: As most systems do not encrypt /boot, private key material is exposed
#       and compromised/untrusted. Boot wireguard network should be
#       **different** & untrusted; versus the network used after booting.
#       Always restrict ports and access on the wireguard server.
#
# Be sure to test wireguard config with a running system before setting
# options. See: https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/wireguard-tools/wg.8.en.html

# Restricting dropbear connections to **only** wireguard:
# * Confirm wireguard/dropbear work without restriction first.
# * Set dropbear listen address to only wireguard client interface address.
